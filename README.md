Document Question Answering (QA) presents a challenge in understanding visually rich documents (VRD), particularly those dominated by lengthy textual content such as research journal articles. Existing studies primarily focus on real-world documents with sparse text, while challenges persist in comprehending hierarchical semantic relations among multiple pages to locate multimodal components. To address this gap, we propose MMVQA, which is tailored for research journal articles, encompassing multiple pages and multimodal information retrieval. Unlike traditional machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks, our approach aims to retrieve entire paragraphs containing answers or visually rich document entities like tables and figures. Our contributions include the introduction of a comprehensive PDF Document VQA dataset, allowing the examination of semantically hierarchical layout structures in text-dominant documents. We also present new VRD-QA frameworks designed to grasp textual contents and relations among document layouts simultaneously, extending page-level understanding to the entire multi-page document. Through this work, our goal is to enhance the capabilities of existing vision and language models in handling challenges posed by text-dominant documents in VRD-QA.
